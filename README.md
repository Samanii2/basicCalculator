Made by Jakob Samani

Developed on Ubuntu.

Do simple calculations with very high precision

made with boost and the mpreal library which you need to download to compile.
This makes the program able to work with very big numbers (about 200 characters).
To make it work without it you would have to change in operatorClass.cpp to make it work with another
number type. This would lower precision, but it should work fine and would be easier to setup.


If you find any errors please let me know.
No known bugs at the moment.
